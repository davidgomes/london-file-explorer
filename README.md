# London File Explorer

## Disclaimer

This is just an experiment with Apollo, GraphQL, React and Electron. *I should not be using apollo-link-state for this*.

## London File Explorer

For fun, I decided to build a file explorer 

## Todo

1. File statistics (size, last updated, owner, â€¦)
2. Distinguish directories from files (better styling)
3. Creating files and directories (with GraphQL Mutations)

## Demo
